It took me a while to figure out how to set up a
[`nix-darwin`](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin) machine to use
[community builders](https://nix-community.org/community-builders/) for Nix
upstream development. This post is a summary of the steps to get it working
transparently to the user.

## Assumptions

- `nix` is configured as [multi-user](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/installation/multi-user.html).
- The machine is managed using `nix-darwin`.
- You have access to the Nix project community builders.

## 0: Register known host keys for community builders

This setting avoids an interactive prompt when connecting to the community
builders for the first time from any user, including `root`.

```nix
  programs.ssh = {
    knownHosts = {
      "aarch64-build-box.nix-community.org" = {
        publicKey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIG9uyfhyli+BRtk64y+niqtb+sKquRGGZ87f4YRc8EE1";
      };
      "build-box.nix-community.org" = {
        publicKey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIElIQ54qAy7Dh63rBudYKdbzJHrrbrrMXLYl7Pkmk88H";
      };
      "darwin-build-box.nix-community.org" = {
        publicKey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKMHhlcn7fUpUuiOFeIhDqBzBNFsbNqq+NpzuGX3e6zv";
      };
    };
  };
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Make sure keys correspond to latest keys as documented in the [official docs](https://nix-community.org/community-builders/).

## 1: Register Host aliases for community builders

This setting instructs all `ssh` clients to use a particular SSH key and
username when accessing the community builders via the aliases.

```nix
  programs.ssh = {
    extraConfig = let
      identityFile = "/Users/${username}/.ssh/id_ed25519";
      user = "booxter";
    in ''
      Host darwin-builder
        Hostname darwin-build-box.nix-community.org
        IdentityFile ${identityFile}
        User ${user}

      Host linux-builder
        Hostname aarch64-build-box.nix-community.org
        IdentityFile ${identityFile}
        User ${user}

      Host linux-x86-builder
        Hostname build-box.nix-community.org
        IdentityFile ${identityFile}
        User ${user}
    '';
  };
```

This setting is important so that `nix-daemon` knows how to connect to the
community builders.

## 2: Install `nixpkgs` SSH client as system package

This setting may be important because some SSH clients, specifically the one
from Homebrew, don't read configuration files from the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d`
directory. The setting guarantees that the `root` user that runs the
`nix-daemon` service will have access to `Host` aliases and `known_hosts`
entries.

```nix
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.openssh ];
```

At this point, any user on the machine, including the `root` user, should be
able to `ssh` into the community builders using the aliases defined in the
previous step.

## 3: Use community builders with `nixpkgs-review` for upstream development

Since community builders are shared and not meant to be used for private
builds, I do not use them for my own builds. Instead, I use them for upstream
`nixpkgs` development to speed up my builds across multiple machines and
platforms.

Instead, whenever I need to test builds with `nixpkgs-review`, I pass builders,
with their relative preferences, to the command, as follows:

```shell
nixpkgs-review pr <PR_NUM> \
    --no-shell --post-result --systems=all \
    --build-args="--builders 'ssh-ng://rosetta-builder aarch64-linux,x86_64-linux - 2 10 - ; ssh://linux-builder aarch64-linux - 10 20 benchmark,big-parallel,kvm,nixos-test ; ssh://linux-x86-builder x86_64-linux - 5 20 benchmark,big-parallel,kvm,nixos-test; ssh://darwin-builder x86_64-darwin,aarch64-darwin - 3 20 big-parallel'"
```

The command will start validation of the `<PR_NUM>` pull request:

- for all supported platforms (`--systems=all`): `x86_64-linux`,
  `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin`, and `aarch64-darwin`.
- using the three community builders (`ssh://linux-builder`,
  `ssh://linux-x86-builder`, and `ssh://darwin-builder`).
- also using the local `rosetta-builder` for `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`
  platforms (with a lower priority than Linux community builders).
- tests and packages that require nested virtualization will only build on the
  Linux community builders (`kvm,nixos-test`).
- packages that require enormous resources will not be scheduled to
  `rosetta-builder` (no `big-parallel` label).

The tool will also use the local `nix-daemon` for native Darwin builds. If this
is not desired, you can also add `--max-jobs 0` to the command.

## Bonus: Monitor community builders load

Since community builders are shared, and since `nix-daemon` doesn't implement a
proper job queue, it's important to monitor the load on the community builders
that your distributed builds produce.

This script will run a `tmux` session with four panes, each running `htop` for
a build machine: three for community builders plus one for the local daemon.

![htop-all.sh](/assets/htop-all.png)

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HOSTS=(
  "darwin-builder"
  "linux-builder"
  "linux-x86-builder"
  "localhost"
)

# Check if tmux is installed
if ! command -v tmux &> /dev/null
then
  echo "tmux could not be found. Please install it first."
  exit
fi

# Check if a tmux session is already running
#
if tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null | grep -q "htop"; then
  echo "A tmux session named 'htop' is already running. Attaching to it..."
  tmux attach-session -t htop
  exit 0
fi

# Create a new tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s htop

# Split the window into 4 panes
tmux split-window -h
tmux split-window -v
tmux select-pane -t 1 # I start my panes numbers from 1, not 0
tmux split-window -v

# Send htop command to each pane
for i in "${!HOSTS[@]}"; do
  host="${HOSTS[$i]}"
  tmux select-pane -t $((i+1))
  if [[ $host == "localhost" ]]; then
    tmux send-keys "htop; exit" C-m
  else
    tmux send-keys "ssh -t $host 'htop'; exit" C-m
  fi
done

# Select the first pane
tmux select-pane -t 0
# Set the window name
tmux rename-window "htop"

# Attach to the tmux session
tmux attach-session -t htop
```

Community builders are often restarted to apply updates, at which point the
corresponding pane is closed. I'm sure there is a way to automatically
reconnect but I went with a binding to kill the `tmux` window:

```
bind-key -T prefix K confirm-before -p "Kill session #S? (y/n)" kill-session
```
